**Google Cloud Deployment Prototype**

* **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Google Compute Engine (GCE) for virtual machines, Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for object storage, and Google Cloud Networking for networking
* **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Google App Engine (GAE) for web applications, Google Cloud Run (GCR) for containerized applications, and Google Cloud Functions (GCF) for serverless applications
* **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Google Cloud SQL (GCSQL) for managed databases, Google Cloud Datastore (GCD) for NoSQL databases, and Google Cloud Bigtable (GCBT) for large-scale analytics

**Deployment Architecture**

* **Web Application**: Deployed on GAE with GCS for static assets and GCSQL for database storage
* **Containerized Application**: Deployed on GCR with GCS for container storage and GCD for database storage
* **Serverless Application**: Deployed on GCF with GCS for function storage and GCBT for analytics storage

**Security and Identity**

* **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Google Cloud IAM for access control and identity management
* **Network Security**: Google Cloud Firewall Rules for network security and Google Cloud VPN for secure networking
* **Data Encryption**: Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) for data encryption and Google Cloud Cloud Storage for encrypted object storage

**Monitoring and Logging**

* **Monitoring**: Google Cloud Monitoring (GCM) for application monitoring and Google Cloud Logging (GCL) for log management
* **Logging**: GCL for log collection and analysis, and Google Cloud BigQuery (GCBQ) for log storage and analysis

**Cost Optimization**

* **Cost Estimation**: Google Cloud Cost Estimator for cost estimation and Google Cloud Pricing Calculator for pricing calculation
* **Cost Optimization**: Google Cloud Cost Optimization for cost optimization and Google Cloud Reserved Instances for reserved instance management

**Deployment Tools**

* **Google Cloud SDK**: For command-line deployment and management
* **Google Cloud Console**: For web-based deployment and management
* **Google Cloud Deployment Manager**: For infrastructure-as-code deployment and management

**Example Code**

* **Python**: Using the Google Cloud Client Library for Python to deploy and manage cloud resources
* **Java**: Using the Google Cloud Client Library for Java to deploy and manage cloud resources
* **Node.js**: Using the Google Cloud Client Library for Node.js to deploy and manage cloud resources

**Best Practices**

* **Use Infrastructure-as-Code**: Use infrastructure-as-code tools like Google Cloud Deployment Manager to manage cloud infrastructure
* **Use Monitoring and Logging**: Use monitoring and logging tools like GCM and GCL to monitor and analyze cloud applications
* **Use Cost Optimization**: Use cost optimization tools like Google Cloud Cost Optimization to optimize cloud costs
* **Use Security and Identity**: Use security and identity tools like Google Cloud IAM to manage access and identity
