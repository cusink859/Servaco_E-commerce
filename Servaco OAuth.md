**OAuth Prototype**

* **Authorization Server**: Responsible for authenticating the user and issuing an access token
* **Resource Server**: Responsible for protecting the resources and verifying the access token
* **Client**: The application that requests access to the protected resources

**OAuth Flow**

1. **Client Registration**: The client registers with the authorization server and receives a client ID and client secret
2. **Authorization Request**: The client redirects the user to the authorization server to authenticate and authorize access
3. **User Authentication**: The user authenticates with the authorization server using their credentials
4. **Authorization Grant**: The user grants access to the client and the authorization server redirects the client to the redirect URI with an authorization code
5. **Token Request**: The client requests an access token from the authorization server using the authorization code
6. **Token Response**: The authorization server issues an access token to the client
7. **Resource Request**: The client requests access to the protected resources using the access token
8. **Resource Response**: The resource server verifies the access token and returns the protected resources to the client

**OAuth Endpoints**

* **Authorization Endpoint**: `https://example.com/oauth/authorize`
* **Token Endpoint**: `https://example.com/oauth/token`
* **Resource Endpoint**: `https://example.com/api/protected`

**OAuth Parameters**

* **client_id**: The client ID issued to the client during registration
* **client_secret**: The client secret issued to the client during registration
* **redirect_uri**: The URI that the authorization server redirects the client to after authentication
* **response_type**: The type of response expected from the authorization server (e.g. code, token)
* **scope**: The scope of access requested by the client
* **state**: A random value used to prevent CSRF attacks
* **code**: The authorization code issued to the client after authentication
* **access_token**: The access token issued to the client after token request
* **token_type**: The type of token issued (e.g. bearer, mac)
* **expires_in**: The lifetime of the access token in seconds

**OAuth Response**

* **200 OK**: The request was successful and the response body contains the access token
* **401 Unauthorized**: The client is not authorized to access the protected resources
* **403 Forbidden**: The client is not allowed to access the protected resources

**Security Considerations**

* **Client Secret**: The client secret should be kept confidential to prevent unauthorized access
* **Access Token**: The access token should be kept confidential to prevent unauthorized access
* **Token Expiration**: The access token should expire after a reasonable period of time to prevent prolonged access
* **Scope**: The scope of access should be limited to the minimum required for the client to function
* **State**: The state parameter should be used to prevent CSRF attacks
