**SSL/TLS Encryption Prototype**

* **Certificate Authority (CA)**: Generate a self-signed CA certificate using OpenSSL
* **Server Certificate**: Generate a server certificate using OpenSSL and sign it with the CA certificate
* **Client Certificate**: Generate a client certificate using OpenSSL and sign it with the CA certificate
* **SSL/TLS Configuration**: Configure the SSL/TLS protocol to use the server and client certificates

**OpenSSL Commands**

* `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout ca.key -out ca.crt -days 365`: Generate a self-signed CA certificate
* `openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout server.key -out server.csr`: Generate a server certificate signing request
* `openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 365`: Sign the server certificate with the CA certificate
* `openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout client.key -out client.csr`: Generate a client certificate signing request
* `openssl x509 -req -in client.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out client.crt -days 365`: Sign the client certificate with the CA certificate

**SSL/TLS Configuration**

* **Server Configuration**:
	+ `ssl_certificate: server.crt`
	+ `ssl_certificate_key: server.key`
	+ `ssl_ca_certificate: ca.crt`
* **Client Configuration**:
	+ `ssl_certificate: client.crt`
	+ `ssl_certificate_key: client.key`
	+ `ssl_ca_certificate: ca.crt`

**SSL/TLS Protocol**

* **Handshake**:
	1. Client initiates a connection to the server
	2. Server responds with its certificate and a random session ID
	3. Client verifies the server's certificate and checks the session ID
	4. Client generates a random session key and encrypts it with the server's public key
	5. Client sends the encrypted session key to the server
	6. Server decrypts the session key with its private key
	7. Server and client use the session key to encrypt and decrypt all subsequent communication
* **Data Encryption**:
	+ Client and server use the session key to encrypt and decrypt all data transmitted between them
	+ Data is encrypted using a symmetric encryption algorithm such as AES

**Security Features**

* **Authentication**: Client and server authenticate each other using their certificates
* **Encryption**: All data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted using a symmetric encryption algorithm
* **Integrity**: Data integrity is ensured using a message authentication code (MAC)
* **Non-repudiation**: Client and server cannot deny sending or receiving data
